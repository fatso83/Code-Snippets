* Now talking on #pygtk

<kaufman> I'm trying to read this PyGTK2-tutorial, and has come to a section about connect_object(). It says "connect_object() is the same as connect() except a callback function only uses one argument and a callback method, two arguments:
<kaufman>   def callback_func(object)
<kaufman>   def callback_meth(self, object)
<kaufman> where object is usually a widget. connect_object() allows the PyGTK widget methods that only take a single argument (self) to be used as signal handlers"

<kaufman>  self.button.connect_object("clicked", gtk.Widget.destroy, self.window)

<marc> it's the difference between gtk.Widget().destroy and gtk.Widget.destroy
<marc> so connect_object('blah', method, widget) is the same as:
<marc> connect('blah', widget.method)

<Juhaz> it changes what object is sent to the callback as first argument. with connect, it's always the same as the widget the signal is connected to, in the example, a button.
<Juhaz> with connect_object it can be specified, and it's the window
<kaufman> Thanks
