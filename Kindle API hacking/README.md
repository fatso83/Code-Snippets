#Reverse engineering the Kindle web management api

This is just some notes (in Norwegian) I jotted down while trying to
find out how Amazon's FIONA system for managing your Kindle archive is
working.

Never got anywhere with it. The system seems easy enough on the surface,
but it seems you have to get hold off a lot of cookies that you need to
pass aroud in order to use it. Never got that far.
