## Other
There are also some notes (in Norwegian and English) I jotted down while trying to
find out how Amazon's FIONA system for managing your Kindle archive is
working, and how I was supposed to use curl to get in.

Thankfully I abandened the idea of scripting this in Bash + cURL, and
starting hacking on a Python version using the Requests library and
BeautifulSoup. Some hours later I finally got in :-)
